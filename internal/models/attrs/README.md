## attrs

This package provides convenience functions for working with typed attributes such
as strings, objects and lists. It lets us define model schemas in a simple and
consistent manner, with more or less the same APIs repeating in each package for
defining required and optional attributes, specifying optional validators, getting
and setting attribute values to/from JSON, etc.
