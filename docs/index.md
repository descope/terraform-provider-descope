# Descope Provider

The [Descope](https://www.descope.com) Terraform Provider lets you manage your Descope project configuration as infrastructure-as-code. Configure authentication methods, define roles and permissions, set up third-party connectors, manage flows, and more—all declaratively in Terraform.

Descope is an authentication and user management platform. The Terraform provider manages _project configuration_ (how your project behaves), not users or tenants (use the [Descope Management API](https://docs.descope.com/api/openapi) or [SDKs](https://docs.descope.com) for those).

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) 1.0 or later
- A Descope **Pro or Enterprise** plan
- A **Management Key** from [Company Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/company) in the Descope console

## Authentication

The provider authenticates with the Descope API using a management key. You can create management keys in the [Company Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/company) section of the Descope console.

~> **Security Note:** Never hardcode your management key in Terraform configuration files, as this risks exposing it in version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager instead.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | A valid management key for your Descope company         |
| `DESCOPE_BASE_URL`       | Override the Descope API base URL (optional, for testing) |

```shell
export DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY="K2..."
terraform plan
```

## Example Usage

### Minimal Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    descope = {
      source  = "descope/descope"
      version = "~> 0.3"
    }
  }
}

# Credentials are read from the DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY environment variable
provider "descope" {}
```

### Creating a Project

```hcl
resource "descope_project" "example" {
  name        = "my-app"
  environment = "production"
  tags        = ["prod"]
}
```

### Full Provider Configuration

If you need to explicitly configure the provider (e.g. in a module or when not using environment variables):

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    descope = {
      source  = "descope/descope"
      version = "~> 0.3"
    }
  }
}

variable "descope_management_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "descope" {
  management_key = var.descope_management_key
}
```
