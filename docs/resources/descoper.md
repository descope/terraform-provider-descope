# descope_descoper (Resource)

Manages a Descope console user and their access control settings. Console users (referred to as "Descopers") are team members who access the [Descope console](https://app.descope.com) to manage projects.

Access is controlled via RBAC, where each Descoper can be granted one of four roles:
- `admin` – Full access to project settings
- `developer` – Can edit flows and configurations
- `support` – Can view user data and audit logs
- `auditor` – Read-only access to audit logs

Roles can be scoped to the entire company, to specific projects by ID, or to all projects with a given tag.

## Example Usage

### Company Admin

```hcl
resource "descope_descoper" "admin" {
  email = "admin@example.com"
  name  = "Alice Admin"

  rbac = {
    is_company_admin = true
  }
}
```

### Developer for Specific Projects

```hcl
resource "descope_descoper" "developer" {
  email = "dev@example.com"
  name  = "Bob Dev"

  rbac = {
    project_roles = [
      {
        role        = "developer"
        project_ids = ["P123abc", "P456def"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Support Access via Project Tags

Grant a support engineer access to all projects tagged `production`:

```hcl
resource "descope_descoper" "support" {
  email = "support@example.com"

  rbac = {
    tag_roles = [
      {
        role = "support"
        tags = ["production"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Multi-Role Access

```hcl
resource "descope_descoper" "multi_role" {
  email = "lead@example.com"

  rbac = {
    project_roles = [
      {
        role        = "admin"
        project_ids = ["P123abc"]
      },
      {
        role        = "developer"
        project_ids = ["P789ghi"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
