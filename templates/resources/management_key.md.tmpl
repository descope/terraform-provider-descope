# descope_management_key (Resource)

Manages a Descope Management Key—a credential used to authenticate programmatic access to the Descope Management API and SDKs. Management keys are used for backend operations such as creating users, managing sessions, and building automation pipelines.

~> **Important:** The `cleartext` attribute (the raw key value) is only available immediately after creation and **cannot be retrieved later** through the API. Store it securely using a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) immediately after `terraform apply`.

Keys can be scoped to restrict which projects they can access, at the company level or per-project or tag:
- **Company roles** – Access to all projects in the company
- **Project roles** – Scoped to specific project IDs
- **Tag roles** – Scoped to all projects with a given tag

See the [Descope documentation](https://docs.descope.com) for the list of valid role names.

## Example Usage

### Company-Level Key

```hcl
resource "descope_management_key" "company_key" {
  name        = "CI/CD Pipeline Key"
  description = "Used by the deployment pipeline to manage users"

  rebac = {
    company_roles = ["<role-name>"]
  }
}

# Store the cleartext key in your secrets manager
output "management_key_value" {
  value     = descope_management_key.company_key.cleartext
  sensitive = true
}
```

### Project-Scoped Key with Expiration

```hcl
resource "descope_management_key" "project_key" {
  name        = "Staging Key"
  description = "Limited access to staging project only"

  # Expires 1 year from a fixed date (Unix timestamp)
  expire_time = 1893456000

  rebac = {
    project_roles = [
      {
        project_ids = ["<project-id>"]
        roles       = ["<role-name>"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Tag-Scoped Key with IP Restriction

```hcl
resource "descope_management_key" "restricted_key" {
  name = "Office Network Key"

  permitted_ips = ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.10"]

  rebac = {
    tag_roles = [
      {
        tags  = ["production"]
        roles = ["<role-name>"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
